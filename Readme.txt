The project consists of a battery-powered Robot vehicle that moves on an elevated surface, and releases tennis balls when it detects an opening on the side of the platform. 
The major digital components included in this robot are:
      1. *Servos*: motor-driven system that can rotate to specific angles
      2. *Ultrasonic Sensor*: senses the distance between the robot and obstacles/walls

These components, as well as the behavior of the motor that allows the robot to move, are controlled by an Arduino Board that is programmed with a software implemented in C++.
